```
An app that ranks the top 100 movies listed on IMDb from 1 to 10. The app will display a top 100 list, showing the average score given by users of the base/farcaster app. This way, both the IMDb ranking and user votes will be visible. Our goal is to compare the opinions of IMDb users with those of app users. Don't forget to display the movie's image, title, release year, IMDb score, and base score all in one place.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

The following files are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added to implement the requested functionality:

```
mini-app/app/page.tsx
mini-app/lib/metadata.ts
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
mini-app/components/movie-list.tsx
mini-app/components/movie-card.tsx
mini-app/app/api/movies/route.ts
```

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact changes.

> mini-app/lib/metadata.ts  
> Add file to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(A)ll/(S)kip all/(D)on't ask again [Yes]: y  

I’ll need a few more files to implement the movie‑ranking UI and the data source.  
Could you add the following files to the chat so I can provide the exact edits?

```
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
mini-app/components/movie-card.tsx
mini-app/components/movie-list.tsx
mini-app/app/api/movies/route.ts
```

Once those are added, I’ll supply the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to create the logo, update the metadata, and wire everything together.
